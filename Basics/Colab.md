# Setting up the environment on Google Colab

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with 
- Zero configuration required
- Free access to GPUs
- Easy sharing

To access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), all you need is a Google account and a browser. Whether you're a **student**, a **data scientist** or an **AI researcher**, Colab can make your work easier. Watch [Introduction to Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to learn more.

You should be able to run all the class demos and do your homeworks using Google Colab. If you need to access lots of computational resources, you can choose to upgrade to [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup).
